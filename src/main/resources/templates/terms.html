  <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>

  <p>By using our car rental service, you agree to the following terms and conditions. Please read them carefully before confirming your rental.</p>

  <h2>1. Rental Agreement</h2>
  <p>The renter is responsible for the vehicle from the moment of pickup until it is returned. Any damage, theft, or loss during the rental period must be reported immediately.</p>

  <h2>2. Age and License Requirements</h2>
  <p>All renters must be at least 21 years of age and hold a valid driverâ€™s license. Additional verification may be required for high-end vehicles.</p>

  <h2>3. Rental Duration</h2>
  <p>Bookings must specify clear start and end dates. Extensions must be requested before the start date, subject to availability.</p>

  <h2>4. Responsibility for Damages</h2>
  <p>The renter will be charged for any damage to the vehicle that is not due to normal wear and tear. Insurance may cover some costs depending on the selected plan.</p>

  <h2>5. Fuel Policy</h2>
  <p>Vehicles must be returned with the same fuel level as at the time of pickup. Fuel shortages may incur additional charges.</p>

  <h2>6. Cancellation Policy</h2>
  <p>Cancellations must be made at least 24 hours before the rental start time for a full refund. Late cancellations may incur a fee.</p>

  <h2>7. Use of Vehicle</h2>
  <p>The vehicle must not be used for illegal purposes, racing, or outside the agreed geographical limits. Violation of this may lead to immediate termination of the rental.</p>

  <h2>8. Holding the Vehicle</h2>
  <p>By clicking the "Confirm Rental" button, you acknowledge that the car will be provided to you on the current date. This action indicates that you are committing to the rental, and the car is being held for you. Once the rental is confirmed, the booking cannot be canceled further, and you are expected to complete the rental process.</p>

  <h2>9. Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have any questions, please contact our support team at <a href="mailto:support@carrental.com">support@carrental.com</a>.</p>

  <h2>10. Return Policy and Overdue Bookings</h2>
  <p>If the vehicle is not returned on or before the specified return date, the system will automatically extend your booking duration by 2 additional days.</p>
  <p>Even if the car is returned within those 2 days, you will still be charged for the full extension period.</p>
  <p>If the vehicle is not returned within the extended period, you will be held fully responsible and may be subject to legal action and additional penalties.</p>

  <p>Thank you for choosing our service!</p>
